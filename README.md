****Description**

Remittances to and within Africa are expensive and slow. For instance, the average cost of a remittance to Africa is about 9%, and it can take several days for the money to arrive. This is a major problem for Africans who rely on remittances from family and friends living abroad. Blockchain has enabled users to invest, purchase, and send money via cryptocurrencies. Therefore, there is a potential for individuals to send money in the form of cryptocurrencies.
